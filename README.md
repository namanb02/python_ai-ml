## Projects

This repository currently includes the following projects:
* ### [Basic NLP Chatbot](./basic_nlp_chatbot.py)
    A simple rule-based or machine learning-powered chatbot demonstrating fundamental Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. This project covers text preprocessing, intent recognition, and response generation.

* ### [Predicting Car Prices](./predicting_car_prices)
    An end-to-end machine learning project focused on predicting car prices based on various features. This includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training (e.g., using regression algorithms), and model evaluation.
